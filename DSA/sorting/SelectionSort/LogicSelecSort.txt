Selection Sort:

It is one of the most basic sorting algorithms just like Bubble Sort and Insertion Sort.

Logic:

1.We start looping from the initial element of the array

2.We take the first element to be the minimum element of the array,
and check if there is a smaller element in the reamaining part of the array.(this is the logic for sorting in ascending order, for 
descending order, we take take the first element to be largest and try to find a larger element).

3.If we find a smaller element, we then replace the first element with the initial element

4.As we loop through, we see that the array starts getting sorted from the beginning( sorted elements get accumulated to the left),
and unsorted elements are left behind.

5.At last we will have no unsorted elements, i.e sorted part of the array is equivalent to the whole array.

Note:
 The loop only has to run n-1 times, the last element will be the largest or smallest(for acending or descending) and already sorted.


Complexity:


Time Complexity--
Best Case  Omega(n^2)
Average    Theta(n^2)
Worst      O(n^2)


Space Complexity--
O(1)
