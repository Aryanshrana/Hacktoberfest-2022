Merge Sort is a sorting algorithm based on Divide and Conquer.It uses recursive approach to meet its requirements.

 Raw Logic:
1. It goes on dividing the array into 2 parts, until the array is undivisble,i.e only a single element is left for each divided part.
(This generates a tree like structure, hence recursive approach).

2.Once divided,it goes on merging adjacent divided parts as well as sorting them simultaneously.The Merging goes on until the whole array 
is received which at last is sorted.

3.This algorithm has two main tasks:

i. Dividing array into halves
ii. Merging adjacent halves and simultaneosly sorting them.


Complexity:

Time Complexity--
Best case       Omega(nlogn)
Average Case    Theta(nlogn)
Worst Case           O(nlogn)

Space Complexity--
O(n)
